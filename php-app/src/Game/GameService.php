/**
 * Wires the pure in-memory rules engine (src/Rules/) to the games/
 * game_players/game_rounds/game_round_scores/game_cards/game_events
 * tables: creating and starting games, resolving one play or pass at a
 * time, and advancing turns/rounds/game completion as they happen. Each
 * public method here is one request/response round trip -- there's no
 * process alive between them, so every bit of turn/round state that
 * matters has to already be in the database by the time a method returns.
 *
 * Round-end also resolves a handful of effectState-tagged hooks set by
 * cards played earlier in the round -- see applyScoreSwaps() (Sneakiness),
 * applyAfterScoringHooks() (Bashfulness/Betrayal/Recklessness/Gluttony/
 * Insecurity), hasSkipScoringMarker()/skipScoringAndAdvance() (Awe), and
 * consumeExtraWinMarker() (Corruption). Every fresh turn's play grants
 * also run through computeFreshGrants(), which layers in whatever
 * perpetual (Hope/Grace/Stubbornness) or one-shot banked
 * (Generosity/Joy) grants the upcoming player's board currently entitles
 * them to, on top of the usual unconditional (Hurt Feelings-aware) base.
 * updateRoundTurnState() also carries forward Vulnerability's
 * discardedThisRound flag every time turn state is written, the same way
 * it does pending_play_grants -- and scoreRoundAndAdvance() takes the
 * already-loaded BoardState from whichever play/pass ended the round
 * rather than reloading, since that flag only lives in memory until
 * these writes persist it.
 *
 * Deliberately out of scope for now: any HTTP/auth layer -- this takes
 * game_player ids directly and treats them as already-authorized.
