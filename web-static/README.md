# web-static

Static web content (HTML/CSS/JS/images) for MoodSwings-Web.

Served directly by the web server, or proxied alongside the [`php-app`](../php-app)
backend (e.g. static assets served from this directory, API/dynamic requests
routed to the PHP app).

## Pages

- `index.html` (`/`) — Login form. If the visitor already has an active
  session (checked via `GET /app/me`), they're redirected straight to
  `/game/`. Links to `register.html`.
- `register.html` — Registration form. On success, shows a message to check
  email for the verification link (login is blocked until verified).
- `game/index.html` (`/game/`) — Placeholder for the actual game. Redirects
  to `/` if there's no active session; otherwise shows the logged-in
  username, a logout button, and a "Friends" button that opens a `<dialog>`
  for managing friends: send a request by username/email, accept/decline/
  block incoming requests, view sent (outgoing) requests, and remove
  existing friends. All of it talks to the `/friends/*` endpoints.

All of the above talk to the PHP API at `/app/*` via `js/app.js`'s helpers,
using the same-origin `session_token` cookie for auth — see
[`../php-app/README.md`](../php-app/README.md) for the API itself.

## Layout

- `css/` — Stylesheets.
- `js/` — Client-side scripts (`app.js` holds shared API helpers; each page
  has its own small script wiring up that page's behavior).
